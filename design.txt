Design Assumptions:

1. Frequency of sensor data incoming is not very high so a single entry to post request is made right now.
2. Server/Node as enough memory to compute statistics in memory


Improvements/Suggestions

1. Take the statistics computation to database level-> Use timeseries database and proper partitioning of data in case the amount and frequency of data is huge.
2. Use api level Caching to respond faster over duplicate queries.
3. Create Jobs to create aggregate over timeframe and make statistics API respons via that
4. Migrate/Explore to distributed computation query engine like spark etc to make parallel query processing faster
5. Aggregate/Club data points at source device to create multiple entries in DB while making single post request
